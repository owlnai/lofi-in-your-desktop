## Usage
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/owlnai/lofi-in-your-desktop/releases/latest) and run it.

## Notes
At the moment only prebuilt **unsigned** Windows binaries are provided. Until there's GitHub Actions support, you'll have to build it on Linux or MacOS.

Since they're unsigned, you might get a Smartscreen warning on Windows. The only way to fix this is getting a EV code signing cert which is too expensive for a OSS maintainer. Again, you can build it and sign it by yourself or simply ignore the warning.
## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
