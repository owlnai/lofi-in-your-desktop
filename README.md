# Lofi in your desltop
Lofi Girl embedded in a lightweight Tauri application.

## Usage
Download the [latest release](/releases/latest) and run it.

At the moment only prebuilt Windows binaries are provided. Until there's GitHub Actions support, you'll have to build it on Linux or MacOS.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
